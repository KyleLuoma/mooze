# Mooze Wildlife Tracker

Web-based wildlife tracking application geared toward the Anchorage, 
AK metro area. Allows users to view recent wildlife sightings reported 
by other users. Users submit sighting reports using a simple control 
pad interface. Their geolocation is automatically submitted if the 
browser allows geolocation data access.
